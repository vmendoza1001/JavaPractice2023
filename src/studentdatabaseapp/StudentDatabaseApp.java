//    Student Database Application
//
//        Scenario: You are a Database Administrator for a university and need to create an application to manage student enrollments and balance.
//
//        Your application should do the following:
//        1. Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
//        2. The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
//        3. The student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
//        4. A student can enroll in the following courses:
//        History 101
//        Mathematics 101
//        English 101
//        Chemistry 101
//        Computer Science 101
//        5. Each course costs $600 to enroll
//        6. The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
//        7. To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance
